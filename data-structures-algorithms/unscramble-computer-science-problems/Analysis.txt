Run time analysis:
This file explains the run time analysis (Worst Case Big O Notation) for each solution.

Task0:
Exceution take O(1) time to access list.
Time Complexcity is  1
Space Complexcity is 1

Task1:
Execution takes O(n) to get all phone numbers and O(n) to find unique numbers. So time complexcity is O(n).
Time Complexcity is O(n)

Task2:
Execution takes O(n) to iterate through all calls to find out longest spent on call.
Time Complexcity is  O(n)
Space Complexcity is 1

Task3
PartA:
Execution takes O(n) to iterate calls and O(nlogn) to sort.
Time Complexcity is  O(nlogn)
Space Complexcity is O(n)

PartB:
Execution takes O(n) to iterate calls.
Time Complexcity is  O(n)
Space Complexcity is O(n)

Task4:
Execution takes O(n^2) to iterate calls and texts, O(nlogn) to sort.
Time Complexcity is  O(n^2)
Space Complexcity is O(n)

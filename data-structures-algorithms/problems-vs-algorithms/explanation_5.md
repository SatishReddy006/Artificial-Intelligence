Explanation: Autocomplete with Tries

Autocomplete trie's can be done using trie node class. So trie node class is implemented to store dynamic strings to insert and to find suffixes. Finally trie class is build with insert and find methods

TrieNode:
Time and space complexity for inserting is O(1).
Time and space complexity for suffixes is O(n*m).

Trie:
Time and space complexity for inserting is O(n).
Time complexity for find is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).

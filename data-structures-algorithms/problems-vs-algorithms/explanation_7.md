Explanation : HTTPRouter using a Trie

This is solved using Trie data structure, so created trie node with value and handler. Created route trie with trie nodes to create routes

RouteTrieNode:
Time complexity is O(n*m)
Space complexity is O(n*m)

RouteTrie:
Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).

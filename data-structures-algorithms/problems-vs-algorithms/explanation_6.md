Explanation : Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

This can be done by going through all the elements in the list, so considering only one element if least index and highest index are equal. otherwise checking if there are two elements in the input list by incrementing index. Finally if more than two elements present in the input list using binary search algorithm to find minimum and maximum.

Time complexity is O(n)
Space complexity is O(1).

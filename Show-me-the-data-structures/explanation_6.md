Explanation : Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Created a set for union & intersection of the two linked list. Then created a new linked list from that set.

Time complexity for union is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
Time complexity for intersection is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
